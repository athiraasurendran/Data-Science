# Designing Data Science or Machine Learning Systems

Building a Data Science (DS) or Machine Learning (ML) system involves more than just coding a model. It requires a systematic approach to ensure the system is **scalable, reliable, and maintainable**.

## 1. Steps to Design a DS/ML System

### Step 1: Problem Definition
- Understand the **business problem**.  
- Define clear **objectives and success metrics**.  
- Example: Predict customer churn, detect fraud, recommend products.

### Step 2: Data Collection
- Collect relevant data from **databases, APIs, or external sources**.  
- Ensure **data quality**: completeness, correctness, and consistency.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- Clean and format the data.  
- Handle **missing values, outliers, duplicates**.  
- Perform **feature engineering** and **scaling/encoding**.  

### Step 4: Model Selection
- Choose ML algorithms suitable for the problem:  
  - Regression → Linear Regression, Random Forest  
  - Classification → Logistic Regression, SVM  
  - Clustering → K-Means, DBSCAN  
  - Recommendation → Collaborative Filtering  
- Consider **bias-variance trade-off**.

### Step 5: Training & Validation
- Split data into **train, validation, and test sets**.  
- Train model and tune **hyperparameters**.  
- Evaluate using **metrics**:  
  - Regression → MSE, RMSE, R²  
  - Classification → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - Clustering → Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index

### Step 6: Deployment
- Deploy the model using:  
  - **Web apps** → Flask, Streamlit  
  - **APIs** → FastAPI  
- Ensure scalability using **cloud services** (AWS, GCP, Azure).

### Step 7: Monitoring & Maintenance
- Track model performance over time.  
- Detect **data drift or model degradation**.  
- Retrain or update the model as needed.
