# Designing Data Science or Machine Learning Systems

Building a Data Science (DS) or Machine Learning (ML) system involves more than just coding a model. It requires a systematic approach to ensure the system is **scalable, reliable, and maintainable**.

## 1. Steps to Design a DS/ML System

### Step 1: Problem Definition
- Understand the **business problem**.  
- Define clear **objectives and success metrics**.  
- Example: Predict customer churn, detect fraud, recommend products.

### Step 2: Data Collection
- Collect relevant data from **databases, APIs, or external sources**.  
- Ensure **data quality**: completeness, correctness, and consistency.
