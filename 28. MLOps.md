# MLOps

- **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is a set of practices that combines **Machine Learning** and **DevOps**.  
- Goal: Automate and streamline the **end-to-end ML lifecycle**, from development to deployment and monitoring.  
- Helps in **building, deploying, and maintaining ML models in production** efficiently.

## Importance of MLOps

- **Faster deployment** → Automate model delivery to production.  
- **Scalability** → Manage large datasets and multiple models.  
- **Reproducibility** → Track experiments and model versions.  
- **Monitoring & Maintenance** → Detect model drift or performance degradation.  
- **Collaboration** → Data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams work together.
