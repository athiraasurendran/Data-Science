# MLOps

- **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is a set of practices that combines **Machine Learning** and **DevOps**.  
- Goal: Automate and streamline the **end-to-end ML lifecycle**, from development to deployment and monitoring.  
- Helps in **building, deploying, and maintaining ML models in production** efficiently.

## Importance of MLOps

- **Faster deployment** → Automate model delivery to production.  
- **Scalability** → Manage large datasets and multiple models.  
- **Reproducibility** → Track experiments and model versions.  
- **Monitoring & Maintenance** → Detect model drift or performance degradation.  
- **Collaboration** → Data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams work together.

## MLOps Lifecycle

Data Collection → Data Preprocessing → Model Training → Model Validation → Deployment → Monitoring & Feedback → Model Retraining

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Data Collection & Management**  
   - Collect, clean, and store data.  
   - Tools: SQL, NoSQL, Data Lakes, Cloud Storage.

2. **Model Training & Experimentation**  
   - Train models and test multiple algorithms.  
   - Track experiments, hyperparameters, and results.  
   - Tools: MLflow, Weights & Biases, TensorBoard.
