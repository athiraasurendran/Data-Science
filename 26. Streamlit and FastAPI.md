## Streamlit and FastAPI

---

## 1. Streamlit  

- **Streamlit** is an open-source Python framework used to create **interactive web apps** for data science and machine learning.  
- Focused on **simplicity and speed**, no need to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.  

### Key Features

- Simple Python scripts to build web apps.  
- Interactive widgets: sliders, buttons, checkboxes.  
- Live updates when code changes.  
- Supports charts and visualizations (Matplotlib, Plotly, Altair).  

### Basic Streamlit App Example

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("My First Streamlit App")
st.write("Hello, Streamlit!")

name = st.text_input("Enter your name")
if st.button("Submit"):
    st.write(f"Welcome, {name}!")
```

### Run Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 2. FastAPI

- FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.

- Based on Starlette and Pydantic.

- Very fast and supports async programming.

- Automatically generates interactive API docs using Swagger UI.


### Key Features

- Fast development and high performance.

- Type hints and data validation.

- Async support for concurrent requests.

- Auto-generated interactive documentation.

### Basic FastAPI Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}

@app.get("/user/{name}")
def read_user(name: str):
    return {"message": f"Welcome, {name}!"}
```

### Run FastAPI App

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

## Streamlit vs FastAPI

| Feature       | Streamlit                              | FastAPI                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Purpose       | Build interactive web apps for data/ML | Build APIs and backend services   |
| Complexity    | Simple, beginner-friendly              | Advanced, for backend development |
| Interactivity | High (widgets, charts)                 | Low (API responses only)          |
| Documentation | Not automatic                          | Automatic Swagger UI docs         |
| Async Support | No                                     | Yes                               |

## Summary

Streamlit → Best for data visualization apps and interactive dashboards.

FastAPI → Best for APIs and backend services, with high performance.

Both are Python-based, but serve different purposes in application development.
