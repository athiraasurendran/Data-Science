# Introduction to Flask

- Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework.

- It is often called a micro-framework because it doesn’t require specific tools or libraries.

- Flask provides the essentials to build web applications — routing, templates, and request handling — while keeping the developer free to add extensions as needed.

## Key Features

- Lightweight and modular — ideal for small to medium web apps.

- Built-in development server and debugger.

- Integrated Jinja2 templating engine.

- RESTful request handling.

- Easily extensible (e.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login).

- Compatible with Python 3+.
