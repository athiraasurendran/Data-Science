# Introduction to Flask

- Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework.

- It is often called a micro-framework because it doesn’t require specific tools or libraries.

- Flask provides the essentials to build web applications — routing, templates, and request handling — while keeping the developer free to add extensions as needed.


## Key Features

- Lightweight and modular — ideal for small to medium web apps.

- Built-in development server and debugger.

- Integrated Jinja2 templating engine.

- RESTful request handling.

- Easily extensible (e.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login).

- Compatible with Python 3+.


## Flask Architecture

A Flask application typically consists of:

1. Routes – Define URL patterns and map them to Python functions.

2. View Functions – Handle requests and return responses.

3. Templates – Use Jinja2 to dynamically render HTML.

4. Static Files – CSS, JavaScript, and images.


## Basic Flask Application

```python
from flask import Flask

# Create Flask app instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Routing

- Routes define the URL paths of the application.
