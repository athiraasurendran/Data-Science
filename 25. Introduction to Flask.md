# Introduction to Flask

- Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework.

- It is often called a micro-framework because it doesn’t require specific tools or libraries.

- Flask provides the essentials to build web applications — routing, templates, and request handling — while keeping the developer free to add extensions as needed.
