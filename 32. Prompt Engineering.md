# Prompt Engineering

- **Prompt Engineering** is the practice of **designing and refining prompts** to get the best results from AI models, especially **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT.  
- Goal: Make the AI **understand the task correctly** and produce **accurate, relevant, and useful output**.

## Why is Prompt Engineering Important?

- LLMs generate **different outputs based on how the prompt is written**.  
- A well-crafted prompt can:
  - Improve **accuracy and relevance**
  - Reduce **ambiguity**
  - Guide the model for **specific tasks**
  - Save **time and compute resources**

## Key Principles of Prompt Engineering

1. **Clarity:** Be specific and clear about the task.  
2. **Context:** Provide relevant background or examples.  
3. **Constraints:** Mention limits like word count, style, or format.  
4. **Step-by-step guidance:** Break complex tasks into smaller steps.  
5. **Examples:** Show input-output pairs to guide the model.
