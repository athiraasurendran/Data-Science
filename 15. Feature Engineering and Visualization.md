# Feature Engineering and Visualization

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve the performance of machine learning models.

Common Techniques:

- Handling Missing Values → mean, median, mode imputation.

- Encoding Categorical Data → One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding.

- Feature Scaling → Normalization, Standardization.

- Feature Extraction → PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

- Creating New Features → ratios, differences, or domain-specific transformations.

## Data Visualization in Python

Visualization helps in:

- Understanding data distribution.

- Detecting patterns, trends, and outliers.

- Communicating insights effectively.

Two main libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn.
