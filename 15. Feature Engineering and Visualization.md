# Feature Engineering and Visualization

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve the performance of machine learning models.

Common Techniques:

- Handling Missing Values → mean, median, mode imputation.

- Encoding Categorical Data → One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding.

- Feature Scaling → Normalization, Standardization.

- Feature Extraction → PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

- Creating New Features → ratios, differences, or domain-specific transformations.

## Data Visualization in Python

Visualization helps in:

- Understanding data distribution.

- Detecting patterns, trends, and outliers.

- Communicating insights effectively.

Two main libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

---

## Matplotlib

- Low-level, powerful plotting library.

- Gives fine control over plots.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]

plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', color='blue', linestyle='--')
plt.title("Simple Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```

Common Plots in Matplotlib:

- Line Plot → plt.plot()

- Bar Chart → plt.bar()

- Histogram → plt.hist()

- Scatter Plot → plt.scatter()

- Pie Chart → plt.pie()
  
## Seaborn

- Low-level, powerful plotting library.

- Gives fine control over plots.
