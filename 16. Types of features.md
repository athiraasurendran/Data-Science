## 1. Types of Features  
In a dataset, **features** are the input variables (columns) used for analysis or prediction.  

- **Numerical Features**  
  - Data with numbers.  
  - Example: Age, Salary, Temperature.  
  - Two types:  
    - Continuous → can take any value (e.g., weight = 65.4).  
    - Discrete → whole numbers (e.g., number of children = 2).  

- **Categorical Features**  
  - Data with labels or categories.  
  - Example: Gender (Male/Female), City (Delhi, Mumbai).  

- **Ordinal Features**  
  - Categories with an order or ranking.  
  - Example: Education (High School < Bachelor < Master).  

- **Date/Time Features**  
  - Data based on time.  
  - Example: Date of Birth, Purchase Date.

## 2. Handling Missing Values  
Datasets often have missing or empty values. They must be handled before training a model.  

- **Remove Missing Values**  
  - Drop rows or columns with too many missing values.  

- **Fill with Mean/Median/Mode**  
  - Numerical → fill with **mean** or **median**.  
  - Categorical → fill with **mode** (most common value).  

- **Forward Fill / Backward Fill**  
  - Fill with the previous or next value (useful in time series).  

- **Advanced Methods**  
  - Use machine learning to predict missing values.

## 3. Outlier Detection  
Outliers are unusual values that are very different from the rest of the data. They may affect model performance.  

- **Visual Methods**  
  - Boxplot  
  - Scatter plot  

- **Statistical Methods**  
  - **Z-Score Method**: values greater than +3 or less than -3 are outliers.  
  - **IQR Method**:  
    - IQR = Q3 − Q1  
    - Outliers are values below (Q1 − 1.5 × IQR) or above (Q3 + 1.5 × IQR).
