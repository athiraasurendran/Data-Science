## 1. Types of Features  
In a dataset, **features** are the input variables (columns) used for analysis or prediction.  

- **Numerical Features**  
  - Data with numbers.  
  - Example: Age, Salary, Temperature.  
  - Two types:  
    - Continuous → can take any value (e.g., weight = 65.4).  
    - Discrete → whole numbers (e.g., number of children = 2).  

- **Categorical Features**  
  - Data with labels or categories.  
  - Example: Gender (Male/Female), City (Delhi, Mumbai).  

- **Ordinal Features**  
  - Categories with an order or ranking.  
  - Example: Education (High School < Bachelor < Master).  

- **Date/Time Features**  
  - Data based on time.  
  - Example: Date of Birth, Purchase Date.
