# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **classes** and **objects**.  

It helps organize code into reusable and modular structures.

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.

It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of the objects.
