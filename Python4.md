# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **classes** and **objects**.  

It helps organize code into reusable and modular structures.

## Class

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.

It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of the objects.

---

### Basic Class Definition

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name   # Instance attribute
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

```
