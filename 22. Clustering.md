# Clustering  

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning technique** used to group similar data points together without predefined labels.

## What Makes a Good Cluster?  
- **Inter-cluster distance** → Distance between different clusters should be large.  
- **Intra-cluster distance** → Distance within a cluster should be small.

## Major Types of Clustering  
1. **K-Means Clustering**  
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**  
   - Agglomerative  
   - Divisive  
3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
