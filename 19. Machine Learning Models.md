# Machine Learning Models  

---

## 1. Logistic Regression  
- Used for **classification** problems.  
- Predicts the probability of a class (output between 0 and 1).  
- Example: Spam detection, disease prediction.  

---

## 2. Naive Bayes  
- Based on **Bayes' Theorem** with an assumption that features are independent.  
- Works well for **text classification** (spam filtering, sentiment analysis).  
- Types: Gaussian NB, Multinomial NB, Bernoulli NB.

## 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- A **non-parametric** algorithm used for both regression and classification.  
- Prediction is based on the **k nearest data points**.  
- Example: Recommender systems, image recognition.

## 4. Hyperparameters  
- Parameters that are **set before training** (not learned from data).  
- Examples:  
  - **K in KNN** (number of neighbors).  
  - **C in Logistic Regression / SVM** (regularization strength).  
  - **Max Depth in Decision Trees**.  
  - **Number of Estimators in Random Forest**.  
- Choosing good hyperparameters is done by **Grid Search** or **Random Search**.
