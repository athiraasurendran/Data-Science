# Machine Learning Models  

---

## 1. Logistic Regression  
- Used for **classification** problems.  
- Predicts the probability of a class (output between 0 and 1).  
- Example: Spam detection, disease prediction.  

---

## 2. Naive Bayes  
- Based on **Bayes' Theorem** with an assumption that features are independent.  
- Works well for **text classification** (spam filtering, sentiment analysis).  
- Types: Gaussian NB, Multinomial NB, Bernoulli NB.

## 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- A **non-parametric** algorithm used for both regression and classification.  
- Prediction is based on the **k nearest data points**.  
- Example: Recommender systems, image recognition.
