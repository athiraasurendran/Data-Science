# Machine Learning Models 

---

## 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Works for both **classification and regression**.  
- Finds the **best separating hyperplane** between classes.  
- Uses **support vectors** (data points closest to the boundary).  
- Can use **kernels** (linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle non-linear data.  
- Example: Face detection, text classification.

## 2. Decision Tree  
- A tree-like model used for **both regression and classification**.  
- Splits data into smaller groups based on **features and conditions**.  
- Easy to understand and visualize.  
- Example: Loan approval, medical diagnosis.  
- **Hyperparameters**: `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `criterion`.

## 3. Random Forest  
- An **ensemble model** (collection of many Decision Trees).  
- Each tree is trained on a random subset of data.  
- Final result = average (for regression) or majority vote (for classification).  
- More accurate and less overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree.  
- Example: Stock price prediction, fraud detection.  
- **Hyperparameters**: `n_estimators` (number of trees), `max_depth`, `max_features`.
