# Machine Learning Models 

---

## 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Works for both **classification and regression**.  
- Finds the **best separating hyperplane** between classes.  
- Uses **support vectors** (data points closest to the boundary).  
- Can use **kernels** (linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle non-linear data.  
- Example: Face detection, text classification.

## 2. Decision Tree  
- A tree-like model used for **both regression and classification**.  
- Splits data into smaller groups based on **features and conditions**.  
- Easy to understand and visualize.  
- Example: Loan approval, medical diagnosis.  
- **Hyperparameters**: `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `criterion`.
