## 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Works for both **classification and regression**.  
- Finds the **best separating hyperplane** between classes.  
- Uses **support vectors** (data points closest to the boundary).  
- Can use **kernels** (linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle non-linear data.  
- Example: Face detection, text classification.
