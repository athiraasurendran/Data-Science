# Reading Data from various Sources

## 1. CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

- Python (pandas):

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```

## 2. Excel Files (.xls, .xlsx)

- Useful for business datasets.

- Python (pandas):

```python
  df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
```

## 3. Text Files (.txt)

- Data stored with delimiters like ,, ;, or \t.

- Python:

## 4. Databases (SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

- Often large datasets stored in relational databases.

- Python (SQLAlchemy + pandas):

```python
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine("mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname")
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM tablename", engine)
```
