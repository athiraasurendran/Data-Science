# Ensemble Learning & Bias-Variance Trade-Off  

---

## 1. Bias-Variance Trade-Off  
- **Bias** → Error from making the model too simple (underfitting).  
- **Variance** → Error from making the model too complex (overfitting).  
- Goal: Find a balance between **low bias** and **low variance** for the best generalization.
