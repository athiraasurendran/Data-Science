# Deep Learning

- Deep Learning (DL) is a **subset of Machine Learning** that uses **neural networks** with multiple layers to learn from data.  
- Can automatically extract **features** from raw data without manual feature engineering.  
- Commonly used for **image recognition, NLP, speech recognition, and autonomous systems**.

## Difference: Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

| Feature | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Feature Extraction | Manual | Automatic |
| Data Requirement | Small to medium | Large datasets |
| Hardware | CPU | GPU (preferred) |
| Training Time | Short | Long |
| Complexity | Less complex | More complex |

## Neural Networks Basics

- **Neurons** → Basic units that process information.  
- **Layers** →  
  - Input Layer → Accepts data  
  - Hidden Layers → Process data using **activation functions**  
  - Output Layer → Produces prediction
