# Deep Learning

- Deep Learning (DL) is a **subset of Machine Learning** that uses **neural networks** with multiple layers to learn from data.  
- Can automatically extract **features** from raw data without manual feature engineering.  
- Commonly used for **image recognition, NLP, speech recognition, and autonomous systems**.

## Difference: Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

| Feature | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Feature Extraction | Manual | Automatic |
| Data Requirement | Small to medium | Large datasets |
| Hardware | CPU | GPU (preferred) |
| Training Time | Short | Long |
| Complexity | Less complex | More complex |

## Neural Networks Basics

- **Neurons** → Basic units that process information.  
- **Layers** →  
  - Input Layer → Accepts data  
  - Hidden Layers → Process data using **activation functions**  
  - Output Layer → Produces prediction  

### Activation Functions

- **Sigmoid** → Outputs between 0 and 1  
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** → Outputs 0 if negative, else linear  
- **Tanh** → Outputs between -1 and 1  
- **Softmax** → Converts outputs into probabilities for multi-class classification

## Deep Learning Architecture

1. **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** → Data flows **forward** only.  
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** → Used for **image/video tasks**, extracts spatial features.  
3. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** → Handles **sequential data** (time series, text).  
   - Variants: LSTM, GRU  
4. **Autoencoders** → Unsupervised DL for **dimensionality reduction** and **anomaly detection**.  
5. **Generative Models** → Generate new data (GANs, Variational Autoencoders).

## Deep Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection** → Images, text, audio, or sensor data.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** → Normalization, tokenization, resizing images.  
3. **Model Design** → Choose network architecture and layers.  
4. **Training** → Feed data, optimize weights using **backpropagation**.  
5. **Evaluation** → Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, RMSE.  
6. **Deployment** → Serve model with Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.
