## Performance Metric on Train and Test Data  

The performance of a model is checked using training data and test data.  

| **Train** | **Test** | **Remarks**             |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| Low       | Low      | **Biased Model** → Underfitting (model is too simple) |
| High      | Low      | **Overfit Model** → Model memorized training data but failed to generalize |
| High      | High     | **Correct Model** → Good fit (generalizes well) |
| Low       | High     | **Doesn't occur** → Impossible situation |
