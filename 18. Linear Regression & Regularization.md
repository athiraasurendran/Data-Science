# Linear Regression & Regularization  

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

## Performance Metric on Train and Test Data  

The performance of a model is checked using training data and test data.  

| **Train** | **Test** | **Remarks**             |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| Low       | Low      | **Biased Model** → Underfitting (model is too simple) |
| High      | Low      | **Overfit Model** → Model memorized training data but failed to generalize |
| High      | High     | **Correct Model** → Good fit (generalizes well) |
| Low       | High     | **Doesn't occur** → Impossible situation |

## Regularization in Linear Regression  

Regularization helps to **reduce overfitting** by adding a penalty to large coefficients.  

- **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**  
  - Adds penalty = `|weights|` (absolute values).  
  - Can shrink some coefficients to **zero** → useful for feature selection.  

- **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**  
  - Adds penalty = `weights²` (squared values).  
  - Shrinks coefficients but never makes them zero.  

- **Elastic Net**  
  - Combination of **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)**.  
  - Useful when there are many features with correlations.

**Summary:**  
- Use **Ridge** when all features are important.  
- Use **Lasso** for feature selection.  
- Use **Elastic Net** when you want both.
