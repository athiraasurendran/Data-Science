## NumPy (Numerical Python)

NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computations. It provides fast and efficient operations on large arrays and matrices.

### Key Features:

- Supports multi-dimensional arrays (ndarray)

- Fast mathematical and logical operations

- Functions for linear algebra, statistics, and random numbers

### 1. Create arrays

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```
