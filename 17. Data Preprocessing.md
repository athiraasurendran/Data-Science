# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is the first step in building a machine learning model.  
It prepares raw data into a clean and usable form.

## 1. Data Scaling (for Numerical Columns)  

Scaling makes all numerical values fall into the same range, which helps models work better.  

- **Min-Max Scaling**
  
  Formula:

  x_scaled = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

Values are scaled between **0 and 1**.  

- **Standard Scaling (Z-score Normalization)**
  
Formula:  

x_scaled = (x - mean(x)) / stdev(x)

Values have **mean = 0** and **standard deviation = 1**.
