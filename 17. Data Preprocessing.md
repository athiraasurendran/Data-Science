# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is the first step in building a machine learning model.  
It prepares raw data into a clean and usable form.

## 1. Data Scaling (for Numerical Columns)  

Scaling makes all numerical values fall into the same range, which helps models work better.  

- **Min-Max Scaling**
  
  Formula:

  x_scaled = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

Values are scaled between **0 and 1**.  

- **Standard Scaling (Z-score Normalization)**
  
Formula:  

x_scaled = (x - mean(x)) / stdev(x)

Values have **mean = 0** and **standard deviation = 1**.

# 2. Encoding (for Categorical Columns)  

Categorical data must be converted into numbers for ML models.  

- **One-Hot Encoding**  
- Creates new columns for each category with 0/1 values.  
- Example: `Color = [Red, Blue] â†’ [Color_Red, Color_Blue]`.  

- **Label Encoding**  
- Assigns a number to each category.  
- Example: `Male = 0, Female = 1`.
